# Java Playground


This repository serves as a personal playground for learning and experimenting with Java.

I am currently following the Udemy Java 17 Masterclass and will be using this space to practice concepts, build small projects, and generally solidify my understanding of the language.

The workspace contains two folders by default:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

Feel free to browse the code, but please note that it's primarily for my own learning and may not represent best practices or production-ready code.

## To do
1- add a spring boot playground app
